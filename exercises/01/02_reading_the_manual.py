        Welcome! As an engineer or researcher, knowing how to find and extract information from 
        device manuals is a critical skill. In this exercise, you will:

        1. Visit a manufacturer's website to find a specific device manual
        2. Upload the manual to verify you found the correct one
        3. Extract specific information from the manual to answer questions

        This helps develop your ability to navigate technical documentation and find important 
        specifications - essential skills for working with laboratory equipment.

        You've completed the exercise on finding and reading device manuals. You've practiced:

        1. Navigating a manufacturer's website to find documentation
        2. Downloading and verifying technical manuals
        3. Extracting specific technical specifications from documentation

        These skills will serve you well throughout your career when working with laboratory equipment
        and other technical devices.

        ### Bonus

        - Share any interesting insights you found in the manual that weren't covered in the questions
